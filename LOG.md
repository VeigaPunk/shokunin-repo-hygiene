# souji-shokunin — LOG (append-only)

## 2026-10-18 — mint (operator directive, orchestrator-minted)

Lane minted by explicit operator directive (2026-10-18): a cleaner shokunin
(掃除) for stale/duplicate/preserved artifacts. Demand evidence, measured at
mint by the orchestrator before scaffolding:

- `b2f2efa` (fleet root) — checkpoint files (15× `launch-*.json`,
  prompts, `prior-owners.json`, `interactive-wall.png`) committed to the
  fleet root; `git merge-base --is-ancestor b2f2efa HEAD` → true at
  2026-10-18. Command: `git show --stat b2f2efa`.
- `shokunin.conf.full-roster-20261015` — operator note claimed byte-identical
  to `shokunin.conf`; measured `cmp` → **DIFFER** (3859 vs 4092 B). Corrected
  fact: it is a superseded snapshot, not a duplicate — still a hygiene
  candidate via the `stale` receipt after diff review.
- lore-shokunin — 19 prunable worktrees of 20 total
  (`git worktree list | wc -l` → 20 lines incl. main; 19 marked `prunable`).
- game-dev-2d-shokunin — 5 prunable worktrees of 6 total.
- kotodama-shokunin — `.scratch/` measures **553M** (`du -sh .scratch`;
  operator note said 1.7G — corrected), with unpushed round-17..22 commits
  (`git log --branches --not --remotes --oneline | wc -l` → ≥10) and a dirty
  tree → NOT-SAFE. This is the r2 `souji-verify` gate's known-false-SAFE
  fixture.

Roster scan (rejected fit) per lane in
`.ufo/scopes/souji-mint-20261018/mint-roster-scan.json`; boundary in
PROVINCE.md; reasoning in MINT.md. Probation: ≥3 verified rounds before any
roster row; recorded as `MANIFEST.json rounds[]` type `mint`.

Corrections to earlier claims are new entries, never rewrites — the two
figure corrections above are the first.
